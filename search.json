Contact Brad Cannell at Michael.B.Cannell@uth.tmc.edu if you have questions about accessing the data.\nThe source data for all of the tables on this website is combined_participant_data.rds, which was created in the file link2care_public/data_survey_21_merge.Rmd and is stored on on the Link2Care SharePoint site at ../Participant Data/R Data/.\nAfter importing the data, we modify it in the following ways before creating the descriptive tables:\n\nKeep rows for visit 1 and 2 only. The descriptive tables on this website currently contain baseline statistics only. Most of the baseline data was collected at visit 1. However, there were a handful of survey measures that were collected for the first time at visit 2.\nKeep rows for randomized participants only. We want the sample to include participants who were randomized only. We do not include participants who attended visit 1, but were not randomized.\n\nThe modifications listed above are made in import_data.R.\nThe table below contains other administrative information about the data for tracking and maintenance purposes.\n\n\nAdministrative information about the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLast updated:\n2023-08-21\nThe date the tables on this website were last updated.\n\n\nSource data:\ncombined_participant_data.rds\nThe name of the dataset used to create the tables on this website.\n\n\nSource data path:\n../Participant Data/R Data/\nThe path to the source data.\n\n\nSource data size:\n8.9 Mb\nThe size of the modified data used to create the tables on this website.\n\n\nSource data row count:\n813\nThe number of rows currently contained in the data used to create the tables on this website.\n\n\nSource data column count:\n1,299\nThe number of columns/variables currently contained in the data used to create the tables on this website.\n\n\nN participants:\n406\nThe number of unique participants in the data used to create the tables on this website.\n\n\nN UCM participants:\n137\nThe number of unique participants in the data who were in the usual care management arm of the Link2Care study.\n\n\nN UCM+SP participants:\n136\nThe number of unique participants in the data who were in the usual care management plus smart phone arm of the Link2Care study.\n\n\nN L2C participants:\n134\nThe number of unique participants in the data who were in the Link2Care arm of the Link2Care study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodebook\nThe full codebook for the source data is available at: https://github.com/brad-cannell/link2care_public/blob/master/codebooks/Combined%20Participant%20Survey%20Data%20Codebook.pdf"
