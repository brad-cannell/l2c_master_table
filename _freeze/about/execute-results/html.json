Rather, this page is intended to assist with site maintenance.\n:::\n\n# Overview of the data\n\nThe data for these tables is currently housed at UTHealth-Houston on the [Link2Care SharePoint site](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/sites/Link2Careproject). Contact Brad Cannell at [Michael.B.Cannell\\@uth.tmc.edu](mailto:Michael.B.Cannell@uth.tmc.edu) if you have questions about accessing the data.\n\nThe source data for all of the tables on this website is `combined_participant_data.rds`, which was created in the file `link2care_public/data_survey_21_merge.Rmd` and is stored on on the [Link2Care SharePoint site](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/sites/Link2Careproject) at `../Participant Data/R Data/`.\n\nAfter importing the data, we modify it in the following ways before creating the descriptive tables:\n\n1. Keep rows for visit 1 and 2 only. The descriptive tables on this website currently contain _baseline_ statistics only. Most of the baseline data was collected at visit 1. However, there were a handful of survey measures that were collected for the first time at visit 2.\n\n2. Keep rows for randomized participants only. We want the sample to include participants who were randomized only. We do _not_ include participants who attended visit 1, but were not randomized.\n\nThe modifications listed above are made in `import_data.R`.\n\nThe table below contains other administrative information about the data for tracking and maintenance purposes. \n\n# Administrative information about the data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Attribute                 |             Value             |                                                           Description                                                            |\n|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|Last updated:             |          2023-08-21           |                                      The date the tables on this website were last updated.                                      |\n|Source data:              | combined_participant_data.rds |                                The name of the dataset used to create the tables on this website.                                |\n|Source data path:         |  ../Participant Data/R Data/  |                                                   The path to the source data.                                                   |\n|Source data size:         |            8.9 Mb             |                             The size of the modified data used to create the tables on this website.                             |\n|Source data row count:    |              813              |                  The number of rows currently contained in the data used to create the tables on this website.                   |\n|Source data column count: |             1,299             |            The number of columns/variables currently contained in the data used to create the tables on this website.            |\n|N participants:           |              406              |                     The number of unique participants in the data used to create the tables on this website.                     |\n|N UCM participants:       |              137              |         The number of unique participants in the data who were in the usual care management arm of the Link2Care study.          |\n|N UCM+SP participants:    |              136              | The number of unique participants in the data who were in the usual care management plus smart phone arm of the Link2Care study. |\n|N L2C participants:       |              134              |               The number of unique participants in the data who were in the Link2Care arm of the Link2Care study.                |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Codebook\n\nThe full codebook for the source data is available at: <https://github.com/brad-cannell/link2care_public/blob/master/codebooks/Combined%20Participant%20Survey%20Data%20Codebook.pdf>\n",
