This website contains multiple web-based tables of baseline descriptive statistics for (nearly) every survey data variable collected as part of the Link2Care project. For more information about the Link2Care project, please see the primary public repository at: https://github.com/brad-cannell/link2care_public.

```{=html}
<!-- 
Import the data that will be used to create the tables.
Import `combined_participant_data.rds`. This dataset is created in `link2care_public/data_survey_21_merge.Rmd`. Additionally, this code assumes that this file is being run from the SharePoint `General` folder.
-->
```
The data for these tables is currently housed at UTHealth-Houston on the [Link2Care SharePoint site](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/sites/Link2Careproject). Contact Brad Cannell at [Michael.B.Cannell\@uth.tmc.edu](mailto:Michael.B.Cannell@uth.tmc.edu) if you have questions about accessing the data.

#| echo: false
df_nm      <- "combined_participant_data.rds"
folder     <- "../Participant Data/R Data/"
path       <- paste0(folder, df_nm)
l2c_survey <- readr::read_rds(path)
df_size    <- l2c_survey |> utils::object.size() |> format(units = "auto")
df_dim     <- dim(l2c_survey) |> format(big.mark = ",")
# df_dim     <- paste0(df_dim[1], " rows and ", df_dim[2], " columns.")
